# Sleep-Timer
A simple C# application that allows users to set a timer, after which the system will automatically go to sleep. The program takes input in minutes and uses a timer to trigger the sleep function, helping users to save energy or automate the sleep mode based on their needs.

Features
User-friendly graphical interface.
Set the sleep timer in minutes.
Automatically puts the system to sleep after the set time.


I have also added the exe file so you would not need to download VS and all

Installation
Clone or download the repository.
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Build and run the application.


Usage
Enter the desired time in minutes in the input field.
Click Set Timer.
The system will automatically enter sleep mode when the timer expires
